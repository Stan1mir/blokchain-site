                            You use the Internet every day. It's a revolutionary technology for sharing <strong>information</strong>—text, images, and videos can be sent across the globe almost instantly. But the internet wasn't built to transfer <strong>value</strong> (like money or property) securely without a middleman. That's why we still rely on banks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Blockchain is the next great technological leap. It's a new kind of digital foundation designed specifically to transfer <strong>value</strong> securely, without needing to trust a central authority.

                        Figure 1-3 outlines the evolution of technology from text-paper to digital formats. At the top, the ‘Text-paper technology’ serves as the starting point. And then one path lead to to ‘Typography’, eventually evolving into the ‘Internet'. The other path leads to ‘Textual Contracts, Signatures, Contract Creation, Payments, Proofs’, which then lead to ‘Blockchain’, representing the digitisation of contractual and transactional processes.(Gong, 2024)

                        <strong>The key takeaway is that while the Internet evolved as the digital successor for text and information, blockchain serves a similar role for transactions and value.</strong>

                <h2>The Core Idea: A Shared, Unchangeable Digital Record! </h2>

                        <p>Instead of one company owning the record book, every participant holds an identical copy. There is no central point of control or failure. This distribution is what builds trust.</p>

                    <li><strong>The Double-Spending Problem:</strong> Answers the question, "How do you make sure a digital dollar is only spent once?" by using a public record everyone agrees on.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Byzantine Generals' Problem:</strong> A metaphor for, "How can a decentralized group who don't trust each other agree on a single truth?" Blockchain solves this with a consensus mechanism.</li>

                <h2>The Next Frontier: Web3 and the Metaverse</h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain is a core component of what many call the "Next Generation Internet" or Web3. The goal is to build a more decentralized, secure, and user-controlled version of the internet. This future internet is envisioned as a "metaverse"—a virtual world not controlled by a single company, where users can interact, own digital assets, and conduct business securely **(Avasthi et al., 2024)**. While still in development, this vision highlights that blockchain's importance will only grow as our lives become more digital.
