                <h1>The Evolution of Blockchain: From Bitcoin to the Future</h1>
                <p>While Blockchain 1.0 (the technology behind Bitcoin) revolutionized digital money, its true potential is far greater. The evolution of the technology shows a clear path from a simple currency system to a global platform for building a new, decentralized internet.</p>
                <hr class="content-divider">
                <h2>Blockchain 2.0: The Introduction of Smart Contracts</h2>
                <p>The next major leap was <strong>Blockchain 2.0</strong>, a movement pioneered by platforms like <strong>Ethereum</strong>. This generation introduced a groundbreaking concept called <strong>Smart Contracts</strong>.</p>
                <h3>What is a Smart Contract?</h3>
                <p>Think of a smart contract as a digital vending machine. It's a piece of code that lives on the blockchain and automatically executes an agreement once certain conditions are met. It works on a simple "IF... THEN..." logic, without needing a human or company to enforce it. Because it runs on the blockchain, the agreement is transparent, permanent, and can't be tampered with.</p>
                <h3>What Can Smart Contracts Do?</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Decentralized Applications (dApps):</strong> These are apps that run on a blockchain network instead of a single company's server, making them resistant to censorship or control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Ownership (NFTs):</strong> A smart contract can act as a permanent, unforgeable certificate of authenticity, proving who owns a unique digital item like art or a collectible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):</strong> Entire organizations can be governed by rules coded into smart contracts, allowing members to vote and make decisions collectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr class="content-divider">
                <h2>Blockchain 3.0: Connecting to the Real World</h2>
                <p>With smart contracts established, <strong>Blockchain 3.0</strong> focuses on solving the biggest challenges of the earlier versions: making the technology faster, more efficient, and connected to the wider world.</p>
                <p><strong>Scalability and Speed:</strong> To be useful for businesses, blockchain networks need to handle a huge volume of transactions. Newer blockchains like <strong>Solana</strong> are designed to process thousands of transactions per second.</p>
                <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Early blockchains use energy-intensive systems. Blockchain 3.0 platforms, such as <strong>Cardano</strong>, use far more energy-efficient models like Proof-of-Stake, addressing environmental concerns.</p>
                <p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> In the beginning, blockchains were isolated. Projects like <strong>Cosmos</strong> and <strong>Chainlink</strong> are building bridges, creating an "internet of blockchains" where different networks can securely share data.</p>
                <hr class="content-divider">
                <p class="concluding-paragraph">This clear evolution—from a secure currency, to a global computer, to a network of interconnected systems—is what makes blockchain a foundational technology for the future.</p>
